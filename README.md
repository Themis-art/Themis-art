## Hi there, welcome to my profile! 👋

💡 I am fueled by curiosity, driven by challenges, and always chasing the next big thing to learn.   

Right now, I’m juggling two worlds: <br>  
🎓 **Business Administration**  <br>
💻 **Systems Analysis & Development**  <br>  
Because I believe that when business strategy and technology work together, extraordinary things happen.   

🚀 As a woman navigating tech and leadership spaces, I’m committed to building inclusive environments, promoting gender equity, and inspiring other women to lead and innovate. I believe in building spaces where ideas matter, people belong, and innovation is inevitable.  

🧠 Naturally curious, I embrace uncertainty, explore new ideas, and tackle complex problems with creativity and focus. I’m passionate about data analytics, Python programming, and creating intuitive, impactful solutions.  

I chase the sweet spot where logic and imagination meet.

🌍 I speak **Portuguese, English, and Spanish** (and can order coffee in French and Mandarin).  I see languages not just as tools for communication, but as bridges that connect ideas, cultures, and opportunities — and as catalysts for meaningful innovation.
